stylist
=======

Simple Django site for grading student code for style. Exposes the admin
interface from the admin module to graders to allow them to enter comments
and score according to a rubric. Requires admin to use CLI to bulk upload
the assignments and to download them too.

This was written as a stopgap measure until we can adapt a more polished
code review tool up and operational.
